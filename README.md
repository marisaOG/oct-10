# dc-review-idr-template-2024-10-22

This repository contains a sample model to be used for the IDR of the Design
Center Review workflow on 2024-10-22. The model is a copy of the [Thermal Model
of a
House](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/thermal-model-of-a-house.html)
example model.

This repository contains both a `main` branch with the original model files, and
a `dev` branch with some sample changes. Our goal of providing this sample
branch is to allow you to walk through the review workflow without needing to
locally setup the repository and connect to GitHub to make changes yourself. You
are more than welcome to experiment with making changes locally and pushing them
to GitHub to be reviewed if you like.
